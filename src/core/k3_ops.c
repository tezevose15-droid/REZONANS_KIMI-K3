/* k3_ops.c - the numeric core of the Kimi K3 engine.
 *
 * Every routine here is gated on a JSON fixture under tests/fixtures/ops/, generated
 * by tools/emit_fixtures.py from the pure-torch reference. Per-op fixtures exist
 * alongside the full-model oracle because the oracle is pass-or-fail: it proves the
 * stack is wrong without indicating which of ~40 kernels is responsible.
 *
 * FLOATING-POINT CONTRACT. This file requires -ffp-contract=off and no -ffast-math;
 * both build systems set them. The kernels are written so that three implementations
 * of the same operation agree exactly:
 *
 *   - the scalar C99 path, which is the reference,
 *   - the OpenMP path (guarded by _OPENMP), which parallelises only over independent
 *     output rows, so it introduces no reduction and changes no arithmetic,
 *   - the AVX2 path (guarded by __AVX2__), which reproduces the scalar code's
 *     four-accumulator partition and reduction tree exactly rather than choosing a
 *     more natural one,
 *   - the NEON path (guarded by __ARM_NEON on aarch64), which maps the same scalar
 *     accumulators onto 2-lane double vectors, element i in the same accumulator and
 *     the same reduction tree, so it is bound by the identical bit-exactness contract.
 *
 * That last point is the reason several loops here look hand-unrolled for no visible
 * gain: the unrolling fixes a summation ORDER that the vector path must match. Reduce
 * them to the obvious form and the paths diverge in the last bits, which shows up as
 * a fixture failure on one machine and a pass on another.
 *
 * Accumulators are double throughout. Hidden size is 7168 and expert rows are 2048
 * wide; a float32 accumulator loses precision the reference comparisons can see.

 *      chain, but it is written out explicitly rather than left to the compiler
 *      because it fixes a summation ORDER. k3_matmul_bf16 and both AVX2 paths
 *      reproduce this exact partition and this exact tree, which is what makes the
 *      three implementations agree bit for bit.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------- Gated MLA ---- */
/* MLA with an optional KV cache, which is what makes incremental decode possible.
 *
 * WHY MLA IS THE ONLY PIECE THAT NEEDS ONE
 *   KDA already carries everything it needs: k3_kda_layer updates its recurrent state
 *   and its ShortConv history in place, so a decode step just declines to clear them.
 *   The attn-res block stack is per token with no cross-token dependency. MLA is the
 *   exception, because softmax attention must see every previous key and value, and
 *   this function recomputes them all from x on every call. That is what makes decode
 *   O(T^2).
 *
 * WHAT IS CACHED, AND WHY NOT THE COMPRESSED LATENT
 *   The obvious saving is to cache the 576-float compressed latent and re-expand it
 *   through kv_b each step, which is 42x smaller. It is also far slower: kv_b is
 *   24576x512, so re-expanding every cached position costs an O(T) sweep of 12.6M-MAC
 *   matmuls per layer per token. The EXPANDED per-head keys and values are cached
 *   instead: 96 heads x 256 floats = 98,304 B per position per layer, and 2.37 MB per
 *   position across the 24 MLA layers. A 64-token generation is therefore 151 MB of
 *   KV cache, small enough not to affect the memory budget at any preset.
 *
 *   The rope slot is cached separately because it is SHARED across heads: 64 values per
 *   position, not per head. Folding it into the per-head block would waste 96x the space
 *   and, worse, invites treating it as per-head somewhere.
 *
 * kvc == NULL selects the self-contained path, which recomputes all keys and values
 * from x and caches nothing. Both paths must produce identical output; the op fixtures
 * gate the uncached path and tests/unit/k3_model.c gates them against each other.

/* y[out] = W[out][in] . x[in], with W stored as bf16 and widened on read.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   The checkpoint ships the dense trunk as bf16. Holding it as fp32 would double the
 *   resident set and double the weight traffic per token. These kernels are bandwidth
 *   bound, so halving the bytes read makes them faster, not slower, the same reason
 *   the MXFP4 path beats dequantise-then-multiply.
 *
 * WHY IT LOSES NOTHING
 *   bf16 is what the checkpoint already contains. Widening bf16 to fp32 is a pure left
 *   shift by 16 bits with no rounding, so multiplying from bf16 storage computes with
 *   exactly the values an fp32 copy would have supplied. The only difference from
 *   k3_matmul is WHERE the widening happens, not what is widened.
 *
 * The accumulator layout mirrors k3_matmul deliberately, four partial sums in double,
 * reduced in the same order, so the two kernels agree to the bit on identical input.
 *
 * THE AVX2 PATH IS BIT-IDENTICAL TO THE SCALAR PATH, not merely close. A __m256d holds
 * exactly four doubles, and loading four consecutive elements per iteration places
 * element i in lane i%4: the same partition as the scalar accumulators, with the same
 * sequential order within each lane. Reducing with (a0+a1)+(a2+a3) then reproduces the
 * scalar result exactly. Two details carry that guarantee:
 *
 *   - MUL THEN ADD, never _mm256_fmadd_pd. The build sets -ffp-contract=off, so the
 *     scalar code rounds the product and the sum separately while an FMA rounds once.
 *     Here the product happens to be exact (a bf16 widens exactly, and float x float
 *     needs 48 mantissa bits, which fits double's 53), so the two would agree anyway
 *     but that is a proof about the inputs. Mul-then-add is a proof about the code.
 *   - The scalar tail loop is reused verbatim for the in % 4 remainder.

/* y[rows] = W[rows][in] . x[in], with W read straight out of packed MXFP4 and never
 * materialised as floats. This is not an optimisation; it is what makes streaming
 * experts possible at all.
 *
 * One routed expert is 33,030,144 parameters. Dequantised to fp32 that is 132 MB, so
 * the 1,472 experts a single token touches would be 194 GB of materialised weights. As
 * packed nibbles the same expert is 17.55 MB. A matrix-vector product is memory bound,
 * so reading 7.5x fewer bytes makes this kernel FASTER than dequantising first.
 *
 * The loop is structured around the 32-element group because the scale is constant
 * within one: it factors out of the inner sum and is applied once per group instead of
 * once per element. At group 32 each group is exactly 16 packed bytes.
 *
 * PRECONDITIONS:
 *   - group <= 64. The expanded group goes into a fixed wf[64] stack buffer.
 *     Checked below; violating it aborts with a FATAL message rather than
 *     overflowing the buffer.
 *   - `in` is even. The packed row stride is in/2 bytes, two elements per byte.
 *     Checked below for the same reason.
 *   - `packed` is rows x (in/2) bytes; `scales` is rows x ceil(in/group) bytes.
 *     Not checked; the caller owns these buffer sizes.
 *   - A scale byte of 255 is NaN by the OCP MX spec and zeroes its whole group.
 *
 * ACCURACY CONTRACT. This kernel is deliberately NOT bit-identical to
 * dequantise-then-k3_matmul, and no caller should assume it is. On AVX2 with a
 * group that is a multiple of 16 (K3 uses 32) it runs the FLAT ROW PATH below: the
 * E8M0 power-of-two scale is folded into each E2M1 weight exactly, and the whole
 * row is summed by sixteen independent double accumulator lanes (four __m256d).
 * Otherwise it sums each
 * group of 32 and applies that group's scale before accumulating. Both orderings
 * differ from dequantise-then-matmul's single accumulator set.
 *
 * The difference is bounded and tiny. Every individual product is EXACT in double, an
 * E2M1 value carries 3 mantissa bits and x carries 24, so the product needs 27 of the
 * 53 available, so only the additions round, and reassociating exact terms moves the
 * result by roughly 1 ULP of double, order 1e-16 relative. The required agreement is
 * 1e-6 against dequantise-then-matmul on real checkpoint weights, gated by
 * tests/unit/test_expert.c. The margin is nine orders of magnitude.
