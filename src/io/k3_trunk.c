/* THE READER, and the two invariants that keep a deeper ring from corrupting output.
 *
 * With one slot in flight the old design could stay informal: the worker held one
 * request, the main thread waited for exactly that request, and the round-robin could
 * not collide with the slot the caller was computing on because there were only ever two.
 * A ring of three or more, kept full, breaks all of these by construction, so the rules
 * are now explicit and enforced in one place, claim_slot_locked:
 *
 *   1. A slot being READ INTO is never handed out again. pending[s] names the layer
 *      whose read is in progress, and a claim skips any such slot. This is the same
 *      hazard K3_SLOT_INFLIGHT solves in the expert cache, and it cost a wrong token
 *      there before it was understood.
 *   2. The slot the CALLER IS CURRENTLY USING is never evicted. `held` names it. Without
 *      this the prefetcher wraps the ring and preads the next layer straight over the
 *      weights the main thread is multiplying: the read succeeds, no pointer changes,
 *      and the run finishes with fluent wrong tokens. That exact failure was measured on
 *      the released checkpoint when a single-slot ring was given a reader thread.
 *   3. A slot holding a layer the walk is ABOUT TO REACH is never evicted either. See
 *      upcoming(). This one costs bytes rather than correctness, which is why it went
 *      unnoticed: the layer is simply read a second time.
 *
 * Everything that touches layer_of, slot_of, ring, pending or the request queue holds
 * io->mu. The READS themselves happen outside it, which is the entire point: the worker
 * and the main thread can both have a transfer in flight.

 * bookkeeping, none of which appears in the engine's own I/O timer -- which brackets only
 * the pread loop and therefore reports a device rate that looks like the disk is
 * saturated while a third of the token is unaccounted for.

/* Is this slot holding a layer the walk is ABOUT to need?
 *
 * The third protection, after "being read into" and "in use by the caller". A layer the
 * prefetcher already fetched and published, but that the walk has not reached yet, is
 * neither of those -- so a claim for a further-ahead layer would evict it, and the walk
 * would arrive a moment later and read it AGAIN. That is invisible in the token stream
 * and shows up only as bytes: measured on the synthetic trunk at ring depth 2, 6.23 MB
 * read against a 4.72 MB bound, and on the released checkpoint as 491 GB read from a
 * 29.81 GB trunk over ten passes.
 *
 * It bites hardest immediately after a PINNED layer, because those hold no ring slot, so
 * `held` is -1 and every slot looks claimable.
 *
 * The window is bounded by the ring itself: a layer the prefetcher could not have reached
 * on this pass is stale from the PREVIOUS one -- layers 91 and 92 still sitting there when
 * the walk has wrapped to layer 0 -- and must stay evictable, or a two-slot ring would
 * deadlock at the start of every pass.
 *
 * WHAT "COULD NOT HAVE REACHED" MEANS, and why the obvious form of it is wrong. The first
 * version measured INDEX distance: layer L is protected when walk < L <= walk + nslot.
 * That is only right when nothing is pinned. k3_trunk_prefetch SKIPS pinned layers while
 * scanning rather than stopping at them, so with pinned layers ahead it queues something
 * many indices out that is only a few SLOTS out -- and the index window then declared it
 * stale and let the next claim evict it, seconds before the walk arrived.
 *
 * So count the layers that would actually TAKE a slot. A ring of nslot slots can hold at
 * most nslot streaming layers ahead of the walk, whatever their indices, which makes this
 * exactly the old test whenever nothing is pinned and a strictly wider one otherwise.
 *
 * Found by sweeping the shape space rather than by reasoning about it: the two hand-built
 * fixtures in tests/unit/test_trunk.c both accepted the index form, and a 93-layer sweep
 * across budgets and ring depths failed 40 of 100 cases against it, worst at 56 pinned
 * layers with a four-slot ring. Two arguments from mechanism about which shape escaped
